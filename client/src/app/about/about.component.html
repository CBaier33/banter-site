        <p class="text-xl">The language is structured off a simple grammar designed by Dr. Saverio Perugini to teach these concepts to introductory students.</p>

Well, bro, there a number of reasons why a student's learning experience could be tainted by a language like Python.

The primary reason is that Python is a "hodgepodge of a language" and tries to be too many things at once.

Students often will miss the entire point of an assignment designed to help them think algorithmically, focusing instead on some shiny and obscure "syntactic sugar", of which Python is chock-full.

For instance, Banter limits arithmetic operations to those between the same type, avoiding weird statements like
"Hello" * 100, or other confusing lines like [y for x in [[1, 2], [3, 4]] for y in x].

        Banter removes these dangerous pitfalls by providing a language stripped of any juicy language features, leaving a simple set of instructions to help new students formulate their ideas into mechanical procedures, which is "the core of computational thinking."</p>
